## Monday, 10/9
No group meeting today. I mainly worked on the EPICS integration of LabView. Primarily, I worked on the database side of things.

## Tuesday, 10/10
Continued work on the EPICS client side of things. I originally thought about integrating the Star Destroyer VI directly to a SoftIOC panel. I have since left that idea, but not entirely. I need more subVIs to properly integrate it, I forgot to grab some.

## Wednesday, 10/11
Worked on the EPICS integration in the beginning of the day. I am working on stripping down the Star Destroyer VI to make it a bare client. This will allow me to put all the motor commands on the client side of things. I need to add a VAL field to the database and maybe add a SETPOINT field to the .dbd file.

In the PM, I checked on my single pulse 30 degree sim. The results aren't great. I'll have to show Chris and see what he thinks. I am still dealing with a good bit of numerical heating.

## Thursday, 10/12

## Friday, 10/13
