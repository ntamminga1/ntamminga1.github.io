catagory: journal

I have decided to start keeping a running journal of each week as I work. This is in an effort to help me organize my thoughts and time aside from the pages I create.

# Monday, 10/2
I do not remember what I did today, since I am writing this on Friday. Today was the first group meeting in a while. The laser is still down, which is the perfect time for integrating EPICS and taking target thickness measurements.

# Tuesday, 10/3
Looked at the Filmetrics instructions from Milo and worked on EPICS. Had lunch and colloquim with Anil in the afternoon.

# Wednesday, 10/4
Met with Anil in the morning after his colloquium and discussed the urgency of getting EPICS integrated while the lab was still down. The goal for integration is mid to late next week. I forgot my laptop at home, so I worked from home on the EPICS integration.

# Thursday, 10/5
Today I mainly worked on the integration of EPICS into LabView. I decided on using a SoftIOC instead of a HardIOC (software based v hardware based) which will lauch upon the opening of the front facing VI. There was also journal club.

# Friday, 10/6
Started working on the single pulse Al sim. Worked on updating my website a bit.
