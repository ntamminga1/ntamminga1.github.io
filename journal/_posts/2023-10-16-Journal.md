## Monday, 10/16
I ran some new Al 30 sims over the weekend to try and deal with the numerical heating. I thought I had found some discrepencies between Ricky and my sims, so I was hopeful that those would resolve the numerical heating issues. However, I still had some numerical heating. Below are Ricky's Au 30 sims compared with my Al 30 sims.
