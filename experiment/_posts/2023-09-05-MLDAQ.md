## This experiment is aimed at collecting a large data set that is useful for the machine learning applications of the group.

Our goal is to run several DAQ sessions, taking data from different parameter sweeps.

#### DAQ Session 1
1. Main Pulse Energy - Constantly varying
   - Full energy sweep (max to min to max) takes about 30s to complete
   - With 1hr of runtime, this gives approximately 120 main pulse sweeps
   - Data is collected through BBB and photodiode. Data includes the shot number, which we can zero with the LabView VI.
   - FINISHED: We can collect diode data with shot number. Stored in HDF5 file. Files also have timestamps of when they close.
   - TODO: Nothing
2. Target Thickness - Incremental variation
   - Increment thickness every main pulse sweep, this is done by adjusting target position vertically.
   - Controls and save in LabView VI.
   - File saves to HDF5 file with all the target data.
   - FINISHED: Increment controls and file saving. We can fully automate target movement and file saving.
   - TODO: Measure target thickness to know how vertical positioning relates to actual target thickness.
3. Laser Focus - Incremental variations
   - Increment focal position after a full run of thicknesses.
   - Laser focal position is adjusted by moving the target along the focal axis in both the positive and negative direction to allow for a full sweep through the focus.
   - File saves to HDF5 with all the target data.
   - FINISHED: INcrement controls and file saving. We can fully automate target movement and file saving.
   - TODO: Find what target position is directly on focus and how big each incremental step is to match saved data to real values.
4. Pre-Pulse Energy - Constant at 0
5. All other target parameters held constant except for adjustment of target.
6. Proton and Electron spectrometer should be working and saving to an HDF5 file through the LabView VI.

Notes:
- Determine minimum useful energy and cap loop there.
- Determine minimum useful target thickenss and cap loop there.
- Determine minimum and maximum useful focal position and cap loop there.

#### DAQ Session 2
1. Pre Pulse Energy - Constantly varying
   - Full energy sweep (max to min to max), time unknown
   - With 1hr of runtime
   - Data is collected through BBB and photodiode. Data includes the shot number, which we can zero with the LabView VI.
   - FINISHED: We can collect diode data with shot number. Stored in HDF5 file. Files also have timestamps of when they close.
   - TODO: Nothing
2. Target Thickness - Incremental variation
   - Increment thickness every main pulse sweep, this is done by adjusting target position vertically.
   - Controls and save in LabView VI.
   - File saves to HDF5 file with all the target data.
   - FINISHED: Increment controls and file saving. We can fully automate target movement and file saving.
   - TODO: Measure target thickness to know how vertical positioning relates to actual target thickness.
3. Laser Focus - Incremental variation
   - Increment focal position after a full run of thicknesses.
   - Laser focal position is adjusted by moving the target along the focal axis in both the positive and negative direction to allow for a full sweep through the focus.
   - File saves to HDF5 with all the target data.
   - FINISHED: INcrement controls and file saving. We can fully automate target movement and file saving.
   - TODO: Find what target position is directly on focus and how big each incremental step is to match saved data to real values.
4. Main Pulse Energy - Constant at max
5. All other target parameters held constant except for adjustment of target.
6. Proton and Electron spectrometer should be working and saving to an HDF5 file through the LabView VI.

Notes:
- Determine mimimum useful energy and cap loop there.
- Determine minimum useful target thickness and cap loop there.
- Determine minimum and maximum useful focal position and cap loop there.

#### DAQ Session 3 - Not Fully Developed
1. Randomly Vary Main Pulse and Pre-Pulse Energies
   - Think of the random variations like each varaible has a different frequency of variation. Adding them together will create a wide covering of different energy combinations. This is illustrated by the below figure.

2. Similar sweep through target thickness and focal position as previous sessions.
3. All other target parameters held constant except for adjustment of target.
4. Proton and Electron spectrometer should be working and saving to an HDF5 file through the LabView VI.

FINISHED: All target sweeps and parameters are set and can save data.
TODO: Plan out best energy frequencies to get best sweeps.

Notes:
- Set min and max of focus and thickness to cap loops.
