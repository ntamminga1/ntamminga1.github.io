## This page is my documentation of retrofitting current LabView VIs to EPICS with the goal of a publication

The first step I took was to convert the Star Destroyer Traget Control LabView VI to EPICS since that controls many variables we want to save. By converting that to EPICS, we would have 5-6 variables in EPICS by only changing one controller. I started to convert the VI over to EPICS, and went down to WPAFB to work on its integration into the lab only to find that all those values are controlled by a single motor control unit, a Newport XPS-Q8. Luckily, this motor control unit has been integrated into EPICS many times at different accelerators. I have decided to use the ASYN and motor control module in EPICS as my integration instead of a secondary LabView VI.

## Integrating Newport XPS-Q8 into EPICS

My first step was to git and compile several different drivers. The [motor control driver](https://epics.anl.gov/bcda/synApps/motor/index.html) in EPICS relies on several other drivers. I first installed the [ASYN driver](https://epics-modules.github.io/master/asyn/) which also required [IPAC](https://github.com/epics-modules/ipac/wiki), re2c, and the [sequence driver](https://github.com/mdavidsaver/sequencer-mirror). The sequence driver is normally found [here](http://www-csr.bessy.de/control/SoftDist/sequencer/), but they recently suffered a cyber attack, so I had to pull an old version backed up to github. This process took some time, but everything eventually worked and ASYN was compiled. For the motor driver, we need ASYN, IPAC, SEQ, and [BUSY](https://epics.anl.gov/bcda/synApps/busy/busy.html). After all of these are properly compiled, edit the proper motor control files and compile. This should come with a Newport Motors subdriver.

Some notes for future installs, be sure to adjust the path in the RELEASE file for every driver as well as any other paths that you may need (check CONFIG_SITE for this as well) and be sure to "make clean uninstall" if ever things are not working when they should.
