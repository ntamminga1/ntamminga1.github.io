title: Double Pulse Aluminum Target Sims
catagory: sims
---

### Work for the upcoming experiment at the Titan Laser facility
We had some major issues between our original Al and Au sims. We realized that our targets in the different sims were different thicknesses, which is a problem. So, I reran the double pulse 30-30 sim with Al, matching the Au sim in all other aspects. Our results were much more similar, and what we expected.

#### Target Deformation
One major area we wanted to look at was the target front as the peak laser intensity hits the target, 700fs. The Al target deforms a lot more than the Au target.
