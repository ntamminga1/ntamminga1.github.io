title: Double Pulse Aluminum Target Sims
catagory: sims

### Work for the upcoming experiment at the Titan Laser facility
We had some major issues between our original Al and Au sims. We realized that our targets in the different sims were different thicknesses, which is a problem. So, I reran the double pulse 30-30 sim with Al, matching the Au sim in all other aspects. Our results were much more similar, and what we expected.

#### Target Deformation
One major area we wanted to look at was the target front as the peak laser intensity hits the target, 700fs. The Al target deforms a lot more than the Au target.

Notice the perturbative features on the front of the Al target. These features formed at spots of destructive interference from the E field magnitude.

#### Particle Energies
We suspected that these were responsible for better Au performance in previous sims. However, when we looked at the particle energies produced by the new Al sim, the change in thickness was the main reason that the previous Al and Au sims were so different. The Al and Au produced similar results, with Au being slightly better.

#### Future Work
This will involve looking at other angles and other materials to determine if the Z is the main difference in the target deformation. We will also look at the E field between the single and double pulse cases.
