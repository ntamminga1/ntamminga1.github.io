Welcome to my research website! This is where I will keep track of my Ph.D. progress and research. I am a part of the Orban HEDP group, focusing on both simulation and experiments of laser-plasma interactions. 

### Timeline

Au23: Working on planning several experiments both at the Wrigth Patt Extreme Light Lab and at the Titan laser at JLF.

Su23: I worked towards collecting a data set that could be used to train a machine learning algorithm with both protons and electrons. Also, I took my [candidacy exam](https://ntamminga1.github.io/paper-poster/).

Sp23: I presented the preliminary proof of concept at the [NIF/JLF User Group Meeting](https://ntamminga1.github.io/paper-poster/). I also continued to work towards collecting another data set for machine learning training.

Au22: I continued working on the summer project and took an advanced course. We collected a proof of concept data set of 2 million data points.

Su22: I started a summer research project with the group focused on collecting a large data set from the Extreme Light Laser at the Wright Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB). My project was to help implement a large scale data aquisition system into the lab to collect data at the 1kHz of the laser.

Sp22: I finished my core courses (E&M, QM, Stat Mech.) and got introduced to the Orban HEDP group.

Au21: I started my graduate work in the fall semester of 2021. During that first year, I took my graduate core courses, E&M, QM, and Classical Mech.
